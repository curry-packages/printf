printf
======

This package provides the library `Data.Format` containing
some operations to format values of basic data types
with arbitrary flags similarly to the `printf` statement of C.

These operations are used by the Curry preprocessor to translate
integrated code with the format tag to replace the format specifiers.

This library follows the C specification for the formatting. This
specification may be found at
